MachineLearnProject
===================

Final project for Practical Machine Learning taught by Dr. Jeff Leek.
To view the knitted code click on the '.md' file which is the best way to view my project. A gh pages was not included as it would be more work for both the grader and myself. Good programmer's are always looking for short cuts!
